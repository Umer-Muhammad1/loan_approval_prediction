🏗️ End-to-End Fraud Detection System
A production-ready machine learning project for loan fraud prediction, implementing a robust MLOps stack featuring Kedro for orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

🚀 Project Overview
This project solves the problem of identifying high-risk loan applications. Unlike standard notebook-based ML, this repository treats the model as a software product, ensuring reproducibility, scalability, and automated quality gates.

Orchestration: Kedro (Data engineering & pipeline management)

Experiment Tracking: MLflow (Model versioning & metrics)

Containerization: Docker (Environment consistency)

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (Automated testing, linting, and image building)

Testing: Pytest & Pytest-Cov

Language: Python 3.10
